# Stability Analysis of NADO Based Closed-Loop Controller
This file is a supplementary material serving for stability analysis of the neural-augmented disturbance observer (NADO) based closed-loop controller. The NADO is an innovatively designed observer introduced in the manuscript "Neural-Augmented Disturbance Estimation," which is submitted to IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics. It can also provide reference for the stability analysis of other similar studies. Standardized and detailed representations can be found in the PDF files.
